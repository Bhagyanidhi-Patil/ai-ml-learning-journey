1. Generative AI
    Definition
    Generative AI is a type of AI that creates new content (text, images, code, audio, etc.) based on the input it receives.
    It responds to prompts but does not act on its own or pursue goals.
    Key Characteristics
        • Content generation
        • Prompt → response
        • No autonomy
        • No decision-making or actions
    Example
    ChatGPT writing an email
        Input: “Write a professional email requesting a meeting.”
    ➡️ Output: A complete email draft
    ➡️ Stops after generating the content


2. AI Agents
    Definition
    An AI Agent is an AI system that can plan and take actions using tools to complete a specific task or goal.
    It often uses Generative AI as its “brain” but adds decision-making and tool usage.
    Key Characteristics
        • Goal-oriented
        • Can use tools (search, APIs, databases)
        • Can perform multiple steps
        • Limited autonomy
    Example
    AI agent booking a flight
        Goal: “Book the cheapest flight from Delhi to London.”
    The agent:
        1. Searches flight websites
        2. Compares prices
        3. Selects best option
        4. Books the ticket
    ➡️ Takes actions, not just text generation


3. Agentic AI
    Definition
    Agentic AI is an advanced AI system where one or more AI agents autonomously (independently) pursue goals over time, make decisions, adapt, and coordinate with minimal human input.
    An AI system can work toward a goal on its own, without needing step-by-step instructions from a human, and can decide what to do next by itself until the goal is achieved.

    It focuses on behavior and architecture, not just a single model.
    Key Characteristics
        • High autonomy
        • Long-term memory
        • Self-planning and adaptation
        • Can work continuously
        • May involve multiple agents
    Example
    Autonomous customer support system
    An agentic AI system:
        • Monitors incoming support tickets
        • Resolves common issues automatically
        • Escalates complex problems
        • Learns from past cases
        • Improves responses over time
    ➡️ Works continuously without being prompted each time
