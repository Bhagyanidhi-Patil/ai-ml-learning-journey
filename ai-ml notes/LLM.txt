LLMs (Large Language Models) are advanced AI systems trained to understand and generate human-like text.
What does “Large Language Model” mean?
	• Large → They’re trained on massive amounts of text data and have billions (sometimes trillions) of parameters.
	• Language → They work with human language (reading, writing, summarizing, translating, coding, etc.).
	• Model → They’re mathematical systems that learn patterns from data.

Examples of LLMs
    Some well-known LLMs include:
	• GPT-4 by OpenAI
	• Claude by Anthropic
	• LLaMA by Meta
	• Gemini by Google DeepMind

LLMs are a type of deep learning model.
    Here’s how it fits together:
	• Artificial Intelligence (AI) → The big umbrella
	• Machine Learning (ML) → AI systems that learn from data
	• Deep Learning (DL) → A subset of ML using large neural networks
	• LLMs → A specific kind of deep learning model designed for language

Why LLMs Are Deep Learning
-> LLMs use deep neural networks with many layers (often dozens to hundreds).

Some Generative AI systems use LLMs.

    • ChatGPT → uses an LLM → which is a type of Generative AI
    • Image generator → uses diffusion model → also Generative AI, but not LLM

How LLMs are built? 

    1️⃣ Collect Massive Text Data
    Training data may include:
        • Books
        • Websites
        • Articles
        • Code
        • Conversations
    The model learns language patterns from this large dataset.

    2️⃣ Tokenization
    Text is broken into smaller pieces called tokens.
    Tokens are converted into numerical IDs so the neural network can process them.

    3️⃣ Choose the Architecture
    Almost all modern LLMs use the "Transformer architecture".
    Transformer Architecture uses attention mechanism .
    Attention allows the model to choose the correct meaning of a word by focusing on relevant surrounding words.

    The key word in both sentences is “bank”, but it means different things:
        1️⃣ “We had our tent near a river bank”
        → Here, bank means the side of a river.
        2️⃣ “I went to a bank to withdraw money”
        → Here, bank means a financial institution.

    4️⃣ Pretraining (Self-Supervised Learning)
    This is the core step.
    The model is trained to:
        Predict the next token in a sentence.
        
    Here are steps it follows: 
    First it is pre training , then mid training and then SFT .  
    In pre training it learns general language patterns from massive text data. 
    In mid training it specialize the model further before instruction tuning.

    5️⃣ Fine-Tuning
    After pretraining, the model is refined.
    Common methods:
        • Supervised fine-tuning (human-labeled examples)
        • Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
    For example, models like GPT-4 by OpenAI were improved using human feedback to make responses safer and more helpful.
    In SFT it will  “Learn to follow instructions properly.”

    In pre training it is just computing next token, but in SFT it will give answer to our questions. 
    Preference fine tuning uses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). 

    6️⃣ Alignment & Safety Training
    Developers add:
        • Safety filters
        • Bias mitigation
        • Content moderation tuning
    This makes the model suitable for public use.

    7️⃣ Deployment
    Finally:
        • The model is compressed/optimized
        • Hosted on servers
        • Exposed via API or apps
    Users interact with it through interfaces like chat systems.

RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) 

The AI learns by humans telling it which answers are good and which are bad.

🧠 Imagine Teaching a Child
	1. The child gives an answer.
	2. You say:
		○ “Good job 👍”
		○ or “No, that’s not right 👎”
	3. The child slowly learns what kinds of answers you like.
RLHF works the same way for AI.

🔁 How It Works (Super Simple Version)
Step 1: The AI learns language
It reads tons of text from the internet to understand how language works.
At this stage:
	• It can talk
	• But it might say weird, wrong, or unsafe things

Step 2: Humans show better answers
People write examples of good answers.
The AI copies and learns from them.

Step 3: Humans compare answers
The AI gives two answers to the same question.
Humans choose:
	“Answer A is better than Answer B.”
The AI learns what humans prefer.

Step 4: The AI improves
It starts giving more answers like the ones humans liked.
Over time it becomes:
	• More helpful
	• More polite
	• Safer
	• Better at following instructions
