NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a field of AI focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, 
and generate human language (text or speech).

📚 What Is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the entire area of AI focused on working with human language.
It includes tasks like:
	• Translation
	• Sentiment analysis
	• Chatbots
	• Speech recognition
	• Named entity recognition
It has existed for decades — even before deep learning.

🤖 What Is an LLM?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a modern deep learning model trained on massive text data to understand and generate language.
Most LLMs are based on the Transformer architecture, introduced by researchers at Google.
Examples include:
	• GPT-4
	• Claude
	• LLaMA

🚀 How NLP Relates to LLMs
Think of it like this:
	• NLP → The whole research field
	• LLMs → A powerful modern tool inside NLP

✅ Traditional NLP – Neat Steps

1️⃣ Data Collection
Gather task-specific dataset
(e.g., movie reviews for sentiment analysis)
2️⃣ Text Preprocessing
	• Lowercasing
	• Remove punctuation
	• Stopword removal
	• Stemming / Lemmatization
3️⃣ Tokenization
Split text into words or phrases.
4️⃣ Feature Extraction
Convert text into numeric features:
	• Bag of Words
	• TF-IDF
	• N-grams
5️⃣ Model Training
Train a machine learning model:
	• Logistic Regression
	• Naive Bayes
	• SVM
6️⃣ Prediction
Model outputs:
	• Class label
	• Translation
	• Extracted information

✅ LLM (Large Language Model) – Neat Steps
🔹 Training Phase
1️⃣ Massive Data Collection
Books, websites, articles, code, etc.
2️⃣ Tokenization
Split text into subword tokens.
3️⃣ Pretraining
Train Transformer model using:
	• Next-token prediction
	• Self-supervised learning
4️⃣ (Optional) Mid-Training
Domain-specific additional training.
5️⃣ Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
Train on high-quality instruction–response pairs.
6️⃣ Alignment (RLHF / DPO)

🔹 Inference Phase (When User Asks a Question)
7️⃣ Input Tokenization
Convert user prompt into tokens.
8️⃣ Transformer Processing
Self-attention across many layers.
9️⃣ Token Prediction
Predict next token repeatedly.
🔟 Output Generation
Return full generated response.

🔹 Traditional NLP (Old Approach)
In classical NLP, we manually do heavy preprocessing like:
    Lowercasing text
    Removing punctuation
    Removing stopwords (the, is, and)
    Stemming / Lemmatization
    Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag of Words)
traditional NLP also does tokenization, usually after (or as part of) preprocessing.


🔹 LLM Approach (Modern NLP)
LLMs do not require heavy manual preprocessing. They mainly do:
    Tokenization (convert text into tokens/subwords)
    Convert tokens → numbers (token IDs)
    That’s it.

    They:
        Keep punctuatio
        Keep stopwords
        Keep casing (sometimes)
        Learn patterns automatically


🔹 Why LLMs Don’t Need Heavy Preprocessing
    Because:
    They are very large (billions of parameters)
    They are trained on huge datasets
    They learn language structure automatically
    Old NLP models were small, so we had to “help” them with manual cleaning.

What Is SVM?
SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for:
	• Classification
	• Regression
	• Outlier detection
It is commonly used in traditional NLP systems (before deep learning became dominant).
in traditional NLP, SVM was commonly used to train models.
in LLMs, neural networks are used for training. 

Example:
If we want to classify emails as:
	• Spam
	• Not Spam
SVM draws a line (in 2D) or a plane (in higher dimensions) that separates the two groups with the maximum margin.


How it works?

🔹 What SVM Actually Creates
SVM creates:
	A hyperplane that separates classes with maximum margin.
	• In 2D → it’s a line
	• In 3D → it’s a plane
	• In higher dimensions → it’s a hyperplane
It does not create a hemisphere.
