Word embedding 

    A word embedding is just:
    A way to turn words into numbers so computers can understand them.
    Computers don’t understand words like humans do. They only understand numbers.

🍎 When You Search “Apple” in Google…
    How does Google know whether you mean:
        • The fruit 🍏
        • Or Apple Inc. (iPhone company)?
    Yes — embeddings are a big part of how this works.

🧠 Step 1: Google Does NOT See Words
    When you type:
        Apple
    Google does NOT see the word like humans do.
    It converts it into numbers (embedding vector).

🔎 Step 2: Context Changes the Embedding
    Now compare these searches:
    🔹 Case A:
        Apple revenue 2025
    Now Google sees:
        • Apple
        • revenue
    The word “revenue” pushes the embedding toward:
        • business
        • company
        • stock
        • finance
    So the embedding becomes closer to:
        • iPhone
        • stock market
        • CEO
        • tech company
    Result:
    You get results about Apple Inc..

    🔹 Case B:
        Apple calories
    Now “calories” pushes the embedding toward:
        • food
        • fruit
        • nutrition
    Now the embedding is closer to:
        • banana
        • orange
        • fruit nutrition
    Result:
    You get fruit information.

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

🧠 First: The Problem
When you search something:
	1. Your query becomes an embedding vector
	2. The system must compare it with millions or billions of stored embeddings
	3. It needs to find the most similar ones
    But comparing with every single vector is too slow.
    So we need a shortcut.
    That shortcut is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH).

🎯 What Is Locality Sensitive Hashing?
    LSH is a trick that helps us:
        Quickly find similar vectors without checking all of them.
        Normal hashing:
            • Completely different inputs → completely different hash
            • Similar inputs → still very different hash
        But LSH is special:
            Similar items → likely go into the same bucket.
        That’s the key idea.

📦 Simple Analogy
    Imagine a huge library with 1 billion books.
    Instead of:
        • Checking every book one by one
    You:
        • Put similar books into the same room
    So if you’re searching for “Apple revenue” (related to Apple Inc.),
    you only go to the “Tech Company” room.
    You don’t check the “Fruit Nutrition” room.
    That saves time.

🔎 How It Works (Conceptually)
    Step 1: Convert everything into embeddings (vectors).
    Step 2: Use LSH to assign vectors into buckets.
    Step 3: When a new query comes:
        • Convert it to a vector
        • Find which bucket it belongs to
        • Only search inside that bucket
    Much faster than scanning everything.

RAG (Retrieval augmented generation) 

RAG is a method that helps AI give more accurate and up-to-date answers by allowing it to look up information before responding.
Instead of only relying on what it learned during training, it can search your data first, then answer.

🧠 The Problem RAG Solves
    Normal LLM:
        • Trained once
        • Doesn’t know your company data
        • Can hallucinate
        • Doesn’t know recent updates
    Example:
    If you ask about your company’s HR policy, the model doesn’t know it.

🚀 What RAG Does
    RAG adds a retrieval step before generating an answer.
    Think of it like:
        Search first → Then answer

🔁 How RAG Works (Step-by-Step)

    1️⃣ Convert Documents to Embeddings
    All your documents (PDFs, policies, manuals, etc.) are converted into embeddings (vectors) and stored in a vector database.

    2️⃣ User Asks a Question
    Example:
        What is our leave policy?
    The question is also converted into an embedding.
    3️⃣ Retrieve Similar Documents
    The system finds the most similar document chunks using vector similarity search.
    4️⃣ Send Context to LLM
    The retrieved documents + the question are sent to the model (like GPT-4).

    5️⃣ Model Generates Final Answer
    Now the answer is based on:
        • The user question
        • Your retrieved documents
    So it becomes:
        • More accurate
        • Grounded in real data
        • Less hallucinated

Lang chain 

LangChain is a python open source framework that helps you build applications using Large Language Models (LLMs).
Think of it as:
A toolkit that connects LLMs with your data, tools, and workflows.

In simple terms, LangChain helps developers connect LLMs to real data, tools, and workflows so they can build smarter apps such as chatbots, AI assistants, document analyzers, and autonomous agents.

🔹 What Problem Does LangChain Solve?
    Large language models are powerful, but on their own they:
        • Don’t remember past conversations well
        • Don’t access external data automatically
        • Can’t easily use tools (like databases or APIs)
        • Struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks
    LangChain provides the structure to solve these issues.

🔹 First: What is an LLM?
    An LLM (Large Language Model) like:
        • GPT-4
        • LLaMA
    is already pre-trained on massive amounts of data.
    Training happens before you ever use the model. It requires:
        • Huge datasets
        • Massive GPUs
        • Specialized ML engineering
    You typically don’t train these yourself.

🔹 So What Does LangChain Do?
    LangChain helps you:
        • Connect LLMs to your app
        • Connect them to databases
        • Let them read PDFs
        • Add memory to conversations
        • Use tools (APIs, search, calculators)
        • Build multi-step workflows
    Think of it like this:
        LLM = Brain
    LangChain = Operating system that helps the brain work inside your app
