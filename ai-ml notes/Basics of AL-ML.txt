🤖 What is AI? 
    AI is when computers are taught to think a little like humans.
    They learn from examples and use what they learn to answer questions, recognize things, or make decisions.
    At a simple level, it’s when computers are designed to do things that usually require human intelligence—like learning, 
    reasoning, understanding language, recognizing images, or making decisions.

    Examples: 
    1. Your phone’s face unlock
        • Humans recognize faces naturally
        • AI is trained on lots of face images
        • It learns patterns (eyes, nose, distance between features)
        • When it sees your face, it says: “This matches what I learned” and unlocks
    It behaves like a human skill (recognizing a face), but it’s really just doing fast pattern matching—not “knowing” you.

    2. Email spam filter 
        • The AI looks at thousands of emails
        • It notices patterns like:
            ○ “WIN MONEY”
            ○ lots of links
            ○ suspicious senders
        • Emails with those patterns usually turn out to be spam
        • When a new email arrives, it checks:
    “Does this match the spam pattern?”
    If yes → spam folder
    If no → inbox
    The AI isn’t reading the email like a human — it’s just spotting familiar patterns and acting on them.

What is machine learning ?

AI is the big idea.
Machine Learning (ML) is one way to do it.

Machine learning is how computers learn from examples instead of being explicitly programmed.
👉 All ML is AI, but not all AI is ML.

What is Deep learning? 

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses many layers of artificial neural networks to learn very complex patterns from data.
A neural network is a way to teach computers by loosely copying how the human brain works.
A neural network is a system of layered neurons that learns patterns from data by adjusting connections.

How it learns (high level)
	1. Guess an answer
	2. Check how wrong it is
	3. Adjust connections slightly
	4. Repeat many times
Over time, guesses get better.
