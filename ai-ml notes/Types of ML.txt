ML is process of teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions based on those patterns.

Training
Training is when the model learns. Teaching computer to learn patterns from data is training. 

Inference
Inference is when the trained model is used. Make decision based on those patterns are inference.

ML example: Bank loan approval system
    Goal: There is a bank and you have to design a system which decides whether a customer should get a loan or not.  
    1. Data collection (what the bank gives ML)
    The bank provides past customer data, for example:
        • income
        • age
        • job type
        • credit score
        • existing loans
        • repayment history (paid on time or defaulted)
    Each past case is labeled:
        • Approved & paid back ✅
        • Approved & defaulted ❌

    2. Learning patterns (training the ML model)
    The ML model looks at this data and learns patterns like:
        • People with high credit score + stable income usually repay
        • People with low credit score + many existing loans often default
    No one writes rules like
    “IF credit score < 600 THEN reject”
    ➡ the model learns this automatically from data.

    3. Decision making (prediction)
    When a new customer applies:
        • The system checks their details
        • Compares them with learned patterns
        • Outputs a result like:
            ○ Approve loan
            ○ Reject loan
            ○ or Approve with higher interest

    4. Improvement over time
        • As more people take loans
        • And repayment results come in
        • The model is retrained
    ➡ decisions get better and more accurate

ML types :

1. Supervised Learning
    Supervised Learning = learning with answers
    Data has input + correct output (labels). The model learns by example.
    Examples:
        • Loan approval (approve / reject)
        • Email spam detection
        • House price prediction

    Type 1: Classification
        👉 Output is a word / category. Output can be binary (like yes or no) or multi-class also. 
        You are asking:
            “Which group does this belong to?”
        Examples:
            • Email → Spam or Not Spam
            • Loan → Yes or No
            • Photo → Cat or Dog
        🔑 Output choices are limited and fixed.

    Type 2: Regression
        👉 Output is a number
        You are asking:
            “How much?” or “How many?”
        Examples:  Swiggy delivery time prediction is a perfect example of supervised learning (regression)
            • House price → ₹45,00,000
            • Temperature → 32.5°C
            • Salary → ₹80,000
        🔑 Output is a number that can change continuously.

2. Unsupervised Learning
    Data has only input, no output labels. 
    In unsupervised learning, input data is given, but it is not labeled or neatly categorized. 
    The ML algorithm itself finds patterns and separates the data into groups (clusters) and anomaly / outliers (Outliers are data points
    that are very different from the rest of the data - rare events, errors) .The model finds hidden patterns on its own. 
    
    What the model does
    It tries to find structure on its own, mainly by:
        • grouping similar things together (clusters)
        • finding hidden patterns

    Type 1 Clustering:
        A clustering problem in unsupervised learning is when we want to group similar data points together without having any labels.

        What makes it a “problem”
            • You have only input data
            • You don’t know the correct groups
            • The algorithm must discover the groups by itself
        Easy example
        Imagine you have customers with data like:
            • age
            • income
            • shopping behavior
        No labels like “premium” or “budget”.
        Clustering will group them into:
            • similar spending habits
            • similar age/income patterns
        Later, humans may name the clusters.
    
    Type 2 Associating:
        The association problem (or association rule learning) in unsupervised learning is about finding relationships between items in data.
        Association problem = discovering which things often occur together.

        Example
        Amazon / Blink it suggest items together because association algorithms learn which products are often bought together.
        So:
            • Many customers buy milk
            • A lot of those same customers also buy bread
            • The system learns this pattern
            • When you add milk → it suggests bread

        Association learning finds “items that go together” based on past behavior.

3. Reinforcement Learning
    Reinforcement Learning is learning by trial and error using rewards and penalties. There are no correct answers given upfront.
    Reinforcement learning teaches an agent to make decisions by rewarding good actions and penalizing bad ones.
    
    How it works (step by step)
        1. Agent takes an action
        2. Environment responds
        3. Agent gets a reward (good) or penalty (bad)
        4. Agent learns which actions give more reward
    Repeat this many times → behavior improves.

    Simple example (real life)
        Teaching a dog 🐶:
            • Sit → treat (reward)
            • Jump on sofa → no treat (penalty)
        Over time, the dog learns what to do.

        At first:
            • Dog tries random actions
            • Sometimes gets treat, sometimes not
        After many repeats:
            • Dog notices:
        “When I sit, I get food”
            • So it chooses sitting more often
        No one tells the dog:
            • “Sit is correct”
            • “Jump is wrong”
        The dog figures it out from rewards.
